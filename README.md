# Basic Django Backend

This project is developed in nextJS and deployed in vercel, in order to show a simple (super simple) implementation of an API. It fetch a json, which is built from django models (backend project).

The goal of the project is to have the simplest implementation of a backend that returns a json, in order to be able to play later with a frontend that consumes this resource.

It was a conceptual test for a few hours, please do NOT use it in a production environment, the repo is purely for educational purposes.
